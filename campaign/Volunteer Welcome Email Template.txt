Hello, test test

Thank you for your interest in Karen Lin's campaign! Karen is running for Trustee in Ward 5. It is the largest area in Mississauga with many different diverse communities. The Mississauga News called her the candidate dashing all political stereotypes. 

This is our campaign site http://Karen4Trustee.com

At the moment, she is actively working with the Sikh community, to ensure everyone's voice is heard. The 72 year old incumbent has been there for so long yet nothing gets done. Many people don't even know who he is or what he does. 

The election is on October 27, so the team will be busy with attending events, door-to-door canvassing, and other activities. She is building a campaign for the youth and by the youth, providing much needed opportunities for our young people in Ward 5. Feel free to contact us with any questions you may have!

If you have sibling, friends, classmates, relatives who are interested in joining this exciting campaign, SPREAD THE WORDS and Grow Our Team. 

Welcome to the team and we look forward to working with you!
